On a regular basis I work as consultant for [Dataflow](http://dataflow.be/). They started to organize Beer&Pizza evenings for which people have to endure a presentation and a discussion about a chosen topic.

They asked me to cover Scrum. There are a million presentations online about the topic. But I wanted to create my own material. Which is probably not highly original and a lot of ideas and metaphors I use are probably from other presentations I have seen.

But this was my first presentation to a public and I see this as a learning experience.
