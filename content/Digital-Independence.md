This is off-topic from my usual content, but recent geopolitical shifts have fundamentally altered how I engage with technology. It's no longer just about convenience versus principles; It feels like we're reaching an inflection point in [digital sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_sovereignty).

My tech journey began in the mid-90s when I was scraping by. While friends upgraded to [Pentium IIIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_III), I nursed a used [Pentium 133MHz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium) with a monitor pulled from corporate dumpster. Paying $100 for [Windows 95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95)? Unthinkable. [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) became my lifeline - not just economically, but educationally. Those [man pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page) and [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/) floppies taught me more than any certification program ever could. The freedom to modify and share code wasn't philosophy; It was survival.

The early web was beautifully anonymous. We were "TheJester@[IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat)" not "John Smith, Social Credit Score 720". When [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) started demanding government IDs in 2007, I thought the world had gone mad. Why would anyone trade their [pseudonymity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonymity) for [Farmville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FarmVille)? My rebellion was practical: self-hosted email on a $5/month [shell account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_account), [POP3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol) clients like [Pegasus Mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_Mail), and fierce protection of my digital aliases.

But principles erode in the face of practicality. Family photos migrated from self-hosted galleries to [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/) because "it's just easier." Each compromise felt small - a [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/) account for [Play Store](https://play.google.com/) access, [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) for testing websites. My consulting income allowed shiny new devices every Christmas, but I lost track of the old me who could recompile a [kernel](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)>) to fix a soundcard driver.

My recent acquisitions tell a different story. The [ThinkPad T480](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadt/thinkpad-t480/22tp2tt4800) cost less than an iPhone charger cable on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/). Maxed out with 24GB RAM and dual SSDs, it runs [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) with [SwayWM](https://swaywm.org/) so smoothly that I forget about [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/). The [Pixel 8 Pro](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_8_pro)? $300 for an "obsolete" display model that'll receive security patches until 2030. What a time to be alive.

But here's the twist: Android updates become irrelevant when you're surgically removing Google's tentacles. My transition map looks like this: [ProtonMail](https://proton.me/mail) with [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) replaces Gmail (done), [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io/) masks addresses at the domain level, and [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) now holds passwords instead of Chrome. The true battlefield is cloud storage - I'm testing [Filen.io](https://filen.io/)'s zero-knowledge encryption against self-hosted [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) on a tiny [Vultr VPS](https://www.vultr.com/). For photos, [Immich](https://immich.app/) looks promising but needs work. My [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/) archive sits encrypted on three separate drives, pending migration.

The endgame is complete digital independence. Swapping [Play Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play_Services) for [MicroG](https://microg.org/) on [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) can be terrifying yet exhilarating - like switching mains power for solar panels. Will [Android Auto](https://www.android.com/auto/) work? Probably not. Do I care anymore? Less each day.

Our collective complacency worries me. Google's original motto lasted barely a decade before becoming "Do the right thing... unless prohibited by law or policy." Now they're bidding on military cloud contracts and normalizing biometric data collection. Friends mock my paranoia, then panic when their entire photo library gets tagged "inappropriate content."

Payment doesn't equal compliance. I pay more now for [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/) and [Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net/) than I ever did for [Google One](https://one.google.com/), but sleep better knowing my emails aren't training some [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model). The hierarchy of needs changed: Don't track me comes before unlimited storage. Open audits matter more than shiny UIs.

The lesson isn't that tech giants are evil. It's that their morality bends with quarterly earnings and lobbying interests. Your data isn't stored - it's potentially hosted by whichever regime wins the next election. The engineer who implements surveillance today might be you in five years when HR demands it for "workplace optimization."

The purge continues. Every service severed feels like cancelling [cable TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television) in 2008 - temporary inconvenience for lasting freedom. Who knows? Maybe I'll finally learn to love the [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) again.
