# Why?

## In the age of video and short video content?

Yes I am writing a new blog in the age video is winning the content game. I will post some videos where you can see 2 things. 

First I suck at doing videos. Over time I got a bit better but it is still not my strong point. Secondly the content is not really suitable to be interesting to watch a video over.

Personally I still prefer to read a written guide on how to do things. Or if you have an opinion I tend to prefer to rewd it then to listen to a boring podcast.
