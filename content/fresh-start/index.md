I have been dabling in blogs since the 90s. I have written some content but never persisted in it or put in discpline forward.

This will be an effort to change that. You could read my [last attempt](http://old.geerttheys.com) but me mindfull there is no https option.

## In the age of video and short video content?

Yes I am writing a new blog in the age video is winning the content game. I will post some videos where you can see 2 things. 

First I suck at doing videos. Over time I got a bit better but it is still not my strong point. Secondly the content is not really suitable to be interesting to watch a video over.

Personally I still prefer to read a written guide on how to do things. Or if you have an opinion I tend to prefer to rewd it then to listen to a boring podcast.
