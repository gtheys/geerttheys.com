I'm Geert Theys, a passionate software engineer and team builder with a focus on backend software and infrastructure. With over two decades of experience, I've honed my skills in architecting robust, scalable solutions and fostering high-performance teams.

My expertise lies in cloud technologies, particularly AWS, where I hold a [Software architect certification](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By2RklfL2_FlbUxHY3lKQkJQYVE/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-aGUHZ-SGfsM9JHGhO6Qoww). I'm deeply committed to leveraging DevOps practices and cloud platforms to drive innovation and efficiency in software development and deployment processes.

As an avid learner and tech enthusiast, I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others. I frequently participate in tech communities and speak at conferences about cloud technologies and DevOps best practices. 

Currently I am deep diving into Data Engineering as I have a [keen interest in AI](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/UAPTPKN7FPG4).

Beyond the digital realm, I'm an adventure seeker with a love for two-wheeled machines. I haven't owned a car in over a decade, preferring the thrill of motorcycles.
 My passions include [moto camping](https://photos.app.goo.gl/BcqHwwnGyhsmocYR9), [racing dirt bikes](https://photos.app.goo.gl/cqhv4umr6Lot6Ejw5), and even [building custom motorcycles](https://www.facebook.com/nomadbkk/). As a dedicated rider, I'm always up for anything involving two wheels.

To maintain a balanced lifestyle, I prioritize fitness and enjoy trying new physical activities. Whether it's a basic gym session or an entirely new challenge, I'm always eager to push my limits.

If you're looking to improve your software delivery processes or need assistance with solution design, I'd be glad to help. Feel free to [book a slot](https://calendar.app.google/XCNsv55sLK1YwMWY8) in my calendar for a discussion.
